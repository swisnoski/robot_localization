# Robot Localization Project 
### Sam Wisnoski, Satchel Schiavo

Our writeup should address the following questions:   
1. What was the goal of your project?
2. How did you solve the problem? (Note: this doesnâ€™t have to be super-detailed, you should try to explain what you did at a high-level so that others in the class could reasonably understand what you did).
3. Describe a design decision you had to make when working on your project and what you ultimately did (and why)? These design decisions could be particular choices for how you implemented some part of an algorithm or perhaps a decision regarding which of two external packages to use in your project.
4. What if any challenges did you face along the way?
5. What would you do to improve your project if you had more time?
6. Did you learn any interesting lessons for future robotic programming projects? These could relate to working on robotics projects in teams, working on more open-ended (and longer term) problems, or any other relevant topic.


We can answer these questions with the following sections: 

## Project Goal:      
#### Introduction:  
Give a brief introduction of our problem, 

#### Individual Learning Goals:   
Write two-three learning goals per person, explain how we divided work to meet those goals 

## Methodology Overview:   
Explain methodology. Want to provide a lot of diagrams, gifs, videos etc here
Basically go through the main loop and describe what happens to our particles as we drive around (initialization, updating, weighting, pose estimation, redistributing) 
Overview the algorithms/equations. 

## Design Decisions:   
Will fill out more of this after we complete the project. Likely, will be about how we initialize/weight/redistribute the particles. 
Why gaussian? Do we reduce the number of particles over time? Satchel wanted to try out a different localization method as well, this 
would be a good place for that. 

## Challenges:   
We are great. We had no challenges whatsoever with this project. 

## Potential Improvements:   
TBD. Maybe that other localization method? Maybe testing it out on the actual robot? 

## Conclusion:  
#### How It Went: 
TBD. 

#### Lessons Learned:   
TBD.
