# Robot Localization Project 
### Sam Wisnoski, Satchel Schiavo

Our writeup should address the following questions:   
1. What was the goal of your project?
2. How did you solve the problem? (Note: this doesnâ€™t have to be super-detailed, you should try to explain what you did at a high-level so that others in the class could reasonably understand what you did).
3. Describe a design decision you had to make when working on your project and what you ultimately did (and why)? These design decisions could be particular choices for how you implemented some part of an algorithm or perhaps a decision regarding which of two external packages to use in your project.
4. What if any challenges did you face along the way?
5. What would you do to improve your project if you had more time?
6. Did you learn any interesting lessons for future robotic programming projects? These could relate to working on robotics projects in teams, working on more open-ended (and longer term) problems, or any other relevant topic.
